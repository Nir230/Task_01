# Data handling

In our data cleaning process, we started by handling missing values, deciding whether to remove or fill in gaps using methods like .dropna() and .fillna(). Next, we removed duplicate records to ensure that no data was being counted twice, using .drop_duplicates(). We also standardized text values, making sure things like country names and other categorical data were consistent, fixing issues like capitalization or variations in names. For date handling, we converted all inconsistent date formats to a uniform dd-mm-yyyy format using pandas' .to_datetime() function. We checked and fixed data types, ensuring columns like release_year were correctly converted to integers and date_added to a proper datetime format. Lastly, we handled inconsistent data formats and ensured everything in the dataset was uniform and easy to work with, making the data cleaner and ready for further analysis. These steps ensure that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and structured in a way that will allow for meaningful analysis.
